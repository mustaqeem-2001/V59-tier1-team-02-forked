## 🎯 Interview Prepper 

Interview Prepper is a role-based interview practice app built with React and deployed on Vercel. The app guides users through a set of questions for a selected role, allowing up to three attempts per question and providing feedback and rationale for answers.



## ⚡ Features

-  Select a role (Scrum Master, Product Owner, UI/UX Designer, Web Developer, Python Developer)

-  Practice questions with 3 attempts per question

- Receive immediate feedback after a correct answer or after three wrong attempts

-  View a results page showing your score and rationale for each question

- Chat assistant for help and guidance, integrated as a pop-up



## 📝 How it Works

1. Select a role from the available options.

2. Answer the questions.

3. Each question allows up to 3 attempts.

4. After a correct answer or 3 wrong attempts, feedback is shown:

    -  Why the correct answer is correct (rationale)

    -  Which option was selected first

5. At the end, see a results page with your total score and feedback for all questions.



## 💬 Chat Assistant

Ask questions about:
 -  The app
 -  Attempts 
 -  Roles
 -  Feedback

The assistant is context-aware and can tell you:

-  Your remaining attempts

-  The role you are practicing for

-  Which question you are currently on

It appears as a pop-up chat for easy access while practicing.
